# Introduction

This project encompasses the extraction of review data from a website through scraping techniques. Utilizing Airflow, we'll orchestrate a data pipeline responsible for the extraction and subsequent storage of these reviews into an S3 bucket.

Following this, we'll execute sentiment analysis on the gathered data. Finally, we leverage Streamlit to deploy an interactive dashboard, facilitating a comprehensive view of the sentiment analysis results, ensuring a user-friendly exploration of the insights derived from the analysis
